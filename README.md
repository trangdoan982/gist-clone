# Clone version of Gist

## Set up

After downloading this repo. You need a few steps to set up
### `npm init`

This command will initialize the project as a NodeJS project

### `npm install`

Download all the packages and dependencies specified in package.json

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

I haven't been able to connect successfully with a remote Database yet (trying MongoDB Atlas). So the databse will be ran locally.

This would require your computer to have installed MongoDB, ideally with Robo3T, which is a Database GUI Viewer. Robo3T allows you to view the changes in the database immediately.

### Create HTTP Request

Since I haven't finished wiring this back-end to the front-end, you would need to fire HTTP requests as a developer :(. I use Postman. 

You can download Postman. Then import the file "Gist Clone.postman_collection.json" into Postman and tinker around with the requests. If I have more time I'll wire the back-end with front-end.
